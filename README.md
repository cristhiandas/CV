## Cristhian Da Silva ([Check my blog to learn more about me](https://cristhiandev.wordpress.com/))
(Please, take 2 minutes to read this 4 paragraphs, if you don't like what you read, feel free to move on to the next CV ;) )

I'm a Full Stack DevOps Engineer working in Santander Technology. I'm always searching for knowledge in different areas. Currently I'm looking for a challenging role that makes me learn more every day since I love problem-solving. One of the things that I love the most about my current role is the chance to learn about the business and being able to implement solutions for that would help the users. Just coding is not enough, I need (and love) to learn everything I can about the business.

In my day to day I pair program build the software using a BDD approach in a fully agile environment, after fulfilling  the requirements of the user story (Including the refactoring) I'd deploy into the different environments for test, and release into the live traffic after the software is approved. When building new micro-service I use a contract first approach in order to have a top to bottom design with a swagger file. In my current role I am deploying into live environment once week, I strongly believe in the benefits of continuous delivery. 

I worked as pro-bono with the UWC-Venezuela foundation as the Head of Logistics and Web Manager, I learned personal management skills and logistic skills. Also While I was at the Simón Bolivar University studying Networking Engineering I had the opportunity to learn and perform different roles, I've developed the University Study Guide's Website learning how to do it on my own.

Software skills are not enough, so I try to make the everyday on the job a fun day, normally I bring home-made cakes for the team, when doing pair programming (if it is allowed) I'll sing with my pair while coding or recommend to take a ping-pong break. Finally, I am the kind of person that would speak my mind about a change, I’d suggest improvements, give my ideas on how to solve an issue and challenge requirements when needed (both for functionality and code itself).

## Skills

#### Autodidact

I love to learn things, when I'm stuck on a challenge I look for the possible solutions and different ways on how to solve the problems. I've learned this Skill at the University.

- In 2015 we created an official Student Group, that way The website is recognized by the Universty and it is used by most of the students.
- The website link is http://gecousb.com.ve/ and it shows my name as the Founding President at the end of the following Link http://gecousb.com.ve/index.php/miembros/ in the "Founder Board of Directors (2016-2017)" section.

#### Work well under pressure

I learn more when I'm under pressure, this is because I do things carefully in order to avoid mistakes, I'm a "dress me slowly for I am in a hurry" guy. When I worked with UWC-Venezuela Foundation I had to learn how to use the e4education platform in a week in order to "build" the Venezuelan website and the final result was a website with all the requirements the Foundation asked. You can see the website with http://www.ven.uwc.org/

#### Leadership

When I was at the University I had control of staff, and while I was at UWC I had a team working with me. In both cases, I learned how to lead people in order to achieve the goals we had set for ourselves.

- I achieved the foundation of the students' group "Geco" at the University, and we managed to turn it into the most useful group of the University.
- I contributed to the growth of the future logistics while doing a document with all the information of the activities we made at the UWC-Venezuela Foundation.
