## Cristhian Da Silva

I'm a Full Stack Junior Developer (Wannabe) that is always searching for knowledge in different areas. I'm looking for a challenging role that makes me learn more every day since I love problem-solving.

While I was at the Simón Bolivar University studying Networking Engineering I had the opportunity to learn and perform different roles, I've developed the University Study Guide's Website learning how to do it on my own. I also worked as pro-bono with the UWC-Venezuela foundation as the Head of Logistics and Web Manager, I learned personal management skills and logistic skills. And currently, I'm learning to code at Makers Academy, the best 16-week software development boot camp.

## Projects

MakersBnB.
Transgressions.

## Skills

#### Autodidact

I love to learn things, when I'm stuck on a challenge I look for the possible solutions and different ways on how to solve the problems. I've learned this Skill at the University.

- At the Simón Bolivar University we didn't have a Website with Guides to Study the different subjects, so I've created the website. It started as a Wordpress blog, then I gathered a team of students and learned how to use Fillezilla to do a better work on the system.
- In 2015 we created an official Student Group, that way The website is recognized by the Universty and it is used by most of the students.
- The website link is http://gecousb.com.ve/ and it shows my name as the Founding President at the end of the following Link http://gecousb.com.ve/index.php/miembros/ in the "Founder Board of Directors (2016-2017)" section.

#### Work well under pressure

I learn more when I'm under pressure, this is because I do things carefully in order to avoid mistakes, I'm a "dress me slowly for I am in a hurry" guy. When I worked with UWC-Venezuela Foundation I had to learn how to use the e4education platform in a week in order to "build" the Venezuelan website and the final result was a website with all the requirements the Foundation asked. You can see the website with http://www.ven.uwc.org/

#### Leadership

When I was at the University I had control of staff, and while I was at UWC I had a team working with me. In both cases, I learned how to lead people in order to achieve the goals we had set for ourselves.

- I achieved the foundation of the students' group "Geco" at the University, and we managed to turn it into the most useful group of the University.
- I contributed to the growth of the future logistics while doing a document with all the information of the activities we made at the UWC-Venezuela Foundation.
